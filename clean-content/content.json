New analytics capabilities improve the viewer experience by giving content owners access for the first time to a broad set of data to better understand their digital audience, including viewer engagement with both content and ads. In addition, Adobe announced advances in content protection with a new cloud DRM service to dramatically simplify the deployment of content protected videos across devices.</p><blockquote><p>“Adobe Primetime has seen rapid adoption by the TV industry since its introduction less than five months ago”</p></blockquote><p>“Adobe Primetime has seen rapid adoption by the TV industry since its introduction less than five months ago,” said Jeremy Helfand, vice president, Video Solutions, Adobe. “Major programmers and pay-TV service providers worldwide including Comcast, NBC Sports, Turner Broadcasting, RTL Group’s M6, Tennis Channel and others already use Primetime today. With more than 29 billion video streams delivered by Adobe customers in Q3 alone, advancements in video measurement and content protection are crucial for these media companies to deliver amazing TV experiences online.”</p><p><b>New Video Analytics</b></p><p>Adobe Primetime now includes Adobe Analytics Essentials for Video, the most powerful video analytics capabilities in the industry. Content owners and distributors are now able to better understand their digital audience and how viewers engage with TV and ad content across devices. New video reports in Adobe Analytics Essentials for Video provide second-by-second insights, such as time spent viewing content, along with start, completion and abandonment rates. Standardized metrics for video content and ads allow users to compare detailed viewer engagement across platforms and devices to enable accurate benchmarking for the first time.</p><p>Adobe Primetime is also introducing a new, real-time QoS (Quality of Service) monitoring service that enables video diagnostics to better understand the quality of the viewer experience, and to optimize content experiences and ad loads. Primetime QoS monitoring is tightly integrated with Adobe Analytics, giving customers an unparalleled, unified set of data across audiences, quality of streams, and other site and app engagement. The new video analytics capabilities also integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructures and can access metadata from third-party solutions. A new pricing model with a flat, per-stream price for video content including video ads stabilizes costs of video analytics and lets users better manage analytics spending.</p><p><b>New DRM Cloud Service</b></p><p>Adobe Primetime DRM continues to be the leader in protecting premium video content online. This core component of the Adobe Primetime platform is already being used by major TV programmers and pay-TV service providers worldwide including AT&amp;T, DirectTV,&nbsp;Fox, Scripps Networks,&nbsp;Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.,&nbsp;Walt Disney Pictures,&nbsp;Vudu and others. Hulu, HBO Go and Comcast are the latest media companies that have adopted Adobe’s DRM technology.</p><p>To help content owners and distributors bring premium content to more devices efficiently, Adobe launched a new cloud-based DRM service to dramatically simplify and manage the deployment of protected videos across platforms. Adobe Primetime DRM is available as a hosted web service in the cloud, handles compliance and robustness, management and scalability, and ensures that new features can be added easily without the need to update software on an on-premises server.</p><p><b>About Adobe Primetime</b></p><p>Adobe Primetime enables programmers and pay TV service providers to capitalize on the rising consumer interest in watching TV across IP-connected screens. The platform tightly integrates Adobe’s video publishing, player, DRM, advertising and analytics solutions to help eliminate the complexity of reaching audiences across devices. The results are greater revenue from ad sales and subscriptions, lower operating costs, and audiences that are more engaged. Adobe Primetime’s interoperable components can be deployed individually to fit specific infrastructure needs, or deployed as an end-to-end solution to handle the entire broadcast-to-IP workflow. Customers of Adobe Primetime include Comcast, NBC Sports, Turner Broadcasting, Tennis Channel and M6 RTL Group. Additional TV programmers and distributors are expected to come online later this year.</p><p><b>Additional Resources</b></p><ul><li class='bwlistitemmargb'><a target='_blank' href='http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fadobe.ly%2F1aXECjC&amp;esheet=50715073&amp;newsitemid=20130924005669&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Cloud+DRM+blog+post&amp;index=1&amp;md5=e434528e92d69cc83182e32410373b79' rel='nofollow'>Cloud DRM blog post</a></li><li class='bwlistitemmargb'><a target='_blank' href='http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fadobe.ly%2F18NNv1d&amp;esheet=50715073&amp;newsitemid=20130924005669&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=State+of+TV+Everywhere+blog+post&amp;index=2&amp;md5=e5a9eb1624f0f51e76e6b2ee72584ce0' rel='nofollow'>State of TV Everywhere blog post</a></li><li class='bwlistitemmargb'><a target='_blank' href='http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fadobe.ly%2F15ki0FD&amp;esheet=50715073&amp;newsitemid=20130924005669&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=M6+blog+post&amp;index=3&amp;md5=66cae8fdcc4e9e9fd7873c4be6337570' rel='nofollow'>M6 blog post</a></li><li class='bwlistitemmargb'><a target='_blank' href='http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fadobeprimetime&amp;esheet=50715073&amp;newsitemid=20130924005669&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Adobe+Primetime+YouTube+Channel&amp;index=4&amp;md5=17d5895aa0d1485c90aabda2066486a0' rel='nofollow'>Adobe Primetime YouTube Channel</a></li><li class='bwlistitemmargb'>Follow <a target='_blank' href='http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.twitter.com%2Fadobeprimetime&amp;esheet=50715073&amp;newsitemid=20130924005669&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=%40AdobePrimetime+on+Twitter&amp;index=5&amp;md5=17732bd54e1d7e3154523b03531e8fd5' rel='nofollow'>@AdobePrimetime on Twitter</a></li><li class='bwlistitemmargb'><a target='_blank' href='http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fsolutions%2Fprimetime.html&amp;esheet=50715073&amp;newsitemid=20130924005669&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Adobe+Primetime+website&amp;index=6&amp;md5=0b6182c3fd7bc65c99e2c31f9e56dfc3' rel='nofollow'>Adobe Primetime website</a></li></ul><p><b>About Adobe Systems Incorporated</b></p><p>Adobe is changing the world through digital experiences.
