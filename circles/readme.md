# CSS3 Rotate Demo

I found a very neat animated gif online (probably off Reddit, I can't recall) and I decided to recreate it.

Then once I had that working, I added some controls to turn on/off some features. All the animation is done via CSS, the JavaScript is only used to add/remove classes.

Source files (Jade and Sass) are in the "src" folder. Even for a demo this small I can't bring myself to work in HTML or plain CSS anymore.
