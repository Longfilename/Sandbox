## Polymer Elements & Content

This project demonstrates three examples of how to load content into a custom Polymer element. This is built off the [Polymer Starter Kit](https://github.com/polymerelements/polymer-starter-kit).

### Install dependencies

With Node.js installed, run the following one liner from the root of your Polymer Starter Kit download:

```sh
npm install && bower install
gulp serve
```

### Prerequisites (for everyone)

The full starter kit requires the following major dependencies:

- Node.js, used to run JavaScript tools from the command line.
- npm, the node package manager, installed with Node.js and used to install Node.js packages.
- gulp, a Node.js-based build tool.
- bower, a Node.js-based package manager used to install front-end packages (like Polymer).
